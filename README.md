Today, I worked on a small but exciting JavaScript project where I dynamically placed random car images on the screen with different rotations, positions, and animations. 🚀

💡 What I Learned:
 ✔ Using JavaScript DOM Manipulation to dynamically create and position elements
 ✔ Implementing randomization for unique placements and transformations
 ✔ Adding CSS animations & easing for smooth UI effects
 ✔ Enhancing UI/UX with a stylish dark theme and glowing button

👩‍💻 Challenges I Faced:
 Initially, I used a single image, but then I improved it by adding multiple car images, size variations, and smooth fade-in animations. It was fun experimenting with different techniques to make the UI more engaging.
